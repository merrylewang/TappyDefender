# TappyDefender

Tappy Defender was created using the Android Studio development environment and written primarily in Java. It is a game similar to Flappy bird, where you have to dodge obstacles, but Tappy Defender saves high scores based on the fastest time to reach 10 Kilometers. Tapping the screen speeds up the player controlled character in both the X and Y directions, while the spaceship slows down and falls when your finger leaves the screen. 

The APK is downloadable from this repository and is labeled tappydefenderfull.apk
